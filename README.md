# Stable-Diffusion-img2img-videos

a simple script addon for https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui
takes video as input, runs it through img2img and then outputs a video with the generated frames.



# Installation
1. Download FFMPEG if you dont have it already:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows/ either install it the way they show it or just put the ffmpeg.exe in the stable-diffusion-webui folder
2. download img2img_video.py and put it in stable-diffusion-webui/scripts
3. start/restart the webui and on the img2img tab you will now have img2img_video in the scripts dropdown.



a lower diffusion value is recommended but feel free to tweak to your likings
